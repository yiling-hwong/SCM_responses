# SCM responses
This repository contains the data and scripts required to reproduce the results of the paper "Characterizing Convection Schemes Using Their Responses to Convective Tendency Perturbations" submitted to the *Journal of Advances of Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)*. 

## Brief description of project

An SCM intercomparison project based on the Linear Response Function framework of Kuang (2010), where we examined the *T* and *q* responses to small convective tendency perturbations.

Participating Single-Column Models (SCMs): WRF, LMDZ, CNRM, UM, SCAM

Convection schemes tested:
1. WRF Kain-Fritsch
2. WRF New-Tiedtke
3. WRF New-Simplified-Arakawa-Schubert
4. WRF Betts-Miller-Janjic
5. WRF Zhang-McFarlane 
6. CNRM PCMT scheme
7. UM Simplified-Betts-Miller
8. UM Mass-Flux scheme (Gregory & Rowntree)
9. SCAM Zhang-McFarlane
10. LMDZ modified-Emanuel scheme + Cold pool formulation
